# My Neural Net

A ML framework I built from scratch before practicals (ie, only using NumPy), to test neural network theory & convince myself they actually work. Looked up multilayer backpropagation, but other than that, simply implemented theory from class. Trained a network within my framework on MNIST & got 96% accuracy, same as my tensorflow model.
